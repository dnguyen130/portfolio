<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)!-->

As a web developer, it's important to create a website to show to other potential employers that you have the tools and knowledge for the industry. This is also a chance for me to apply the skills and technologies I've learned into a personal project without worrying about adhering to certain rules laid out in a team.

The project will be based on the Next.js framework as its the one I have grown accustomed to. I hope to add animations, responsiveness, and a smooth user interface and experience. It is currently in development so stay tuned!

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [x] Base Layout
- [x] Responsiveness
- [x] Animations/Transitions
- [ ] Light/Dark Mode

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Revamp

After some time, it was finally time to revamp the portfolio to make it responsive. With a dynamic
project page and page transitions, it reflects my ability to create a website that I'm proud of.

<!-- ## Dream Features / Plan to Add

- [ ] Glass / Aurora UI to toolkit section
- [ ] Additional projects (design and UI/UX related)
- [ ] Tab-style project section once other projects added
- [ ] Separate pages for project case studies / in-depth deescriptions
- [ ] Add transitions between pages once additional pages are done
- [ ] Expanded top navigation to projects
- [ ] Responsiveness for tablets, phones, and other small devices
- [ ] Dynamic background with floating shapes (if it's not too busy)
- [ ] Modal and animation on sending an email?
- [ ] Left navigation icons light up when that area is scrolled on (something to do with inView?) -->

<!-- ## Known Bugs

- [ ] OnMe carousel drag click is broken, might look into either disabling or fixing, depending on which is better for usability. -->
